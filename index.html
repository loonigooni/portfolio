                    <p>I am a student attending Thinkful, enrolled in the Software Engineering Program. 
                    I originated in Seattle but my current position is Tri-Cities Washington. I have been 
                    thoroughly enjoying myself learning and growing my personal web dev arsenal. I still 
                    have much to learn but I look forward to the challenges that come my way.</p>

                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>
                        My interest in coding started in highschool when I enrolled into a game design class.
                        I enjoyed the class very much and decided to try cyber security and design as well. So far
                        web develeopment encapsulates a lot of elements from all the courses and tests me creativaly
                        and technically. I would love to collaborate with other talented engineers and hove our ideas
                        come to life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of career pursuing I have a lot of nerdy hobbies. I built my first computer in
                        2013 and since have built dozens of systems since then for myself as well as family
                        and friends. I use my current PC for various things such as audio engineering, 3D modelling, 
                        virtual reality, as well as gaming. When I'm done being
                        a total nerd I also like to work on my car and cook :)

                        Pokedex app that requests data using the PokeAPI. You can input either the name or
                        numerical ID of any pokemon and it will display the stats and details as well as
                        a cute sprite of the Pokemon. This project helped refine my HTML, CSS, and JS skills.
                        Also my first project using a public API.

                        animals. I built this app to showcase my understanding of DOM manipulation as well as 
                        applying jQuery.
